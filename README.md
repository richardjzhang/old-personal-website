This project is my personal website. It's pretty barebones at the moment and has gone through a few iterations.

If you're interested in using it as a template feel free to fork the repo.

## To start the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
