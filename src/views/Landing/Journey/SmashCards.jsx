        SMASH! Sydney Manga and Anime Show is a Japanese pop culture convention
        that is devoted to artists, creators and fans alike. It has become a
        driving force in Australiaâ€™s anime and manga community, attracting
        thousands of visitors every year.

        During my time here, the structure of SMASH! was undergoing immense
        change. I was lucky enough to be part of the Treasury team to help
        oversee and implement some of these changes, one of them being the
        development of an integrated invoicing system that would formalise
        requests across departments of SMASH.
